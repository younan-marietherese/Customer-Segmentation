# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques

This project focuses on **Customer Segmentation**, which is a key practice in business analytics for grouping customers based on their demographics and spending behaviors. By dividing customers into distinct segments, businesses can develop more targeted strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize marketing efforts.

---

## Project Overview
In today's competitive market, understanding customers is crucial for success. Businesses canâ€™t cater to every customer individually, but by segmenting them into groups, they can better tailor their offerings and marketing strategies. This project explores customer segmentation using methods such as **hierarchical clustering**, **RFM segmentation**, and **K-means clustering**.

The goal is to group customers based on both their personalities (demographics) and spending behaviors, providing valuable insights into their characteristics and habits.

---

## Objectives
- Use customer data and transaction datasets to perform customer segmentation.
- Apply different clustering methods like K-means clustering and RFM segmentation to create meaningful customer groups.
- Analyze customer segments based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the segmentation models.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For clustering methods like K-means.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.

---

## Dataset
The project uses a customer dataset that contains:
- **Demographics**: Including age, gender, and other personal attributes.
- **Transactional data**: Including purchase history, frequency, and monetary spending.

The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and create derived attributes for segmentation.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the data by handling missing values and scaling features where necessary.
   - Combine transactional data with demographic attributes to create a comprehensive customer profile.
   
2. **Clustering Models**:
   - Implement **RFM Segmentation** to segment customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary spending.
   - Apply **K-means clustering** to group customers into distinct segments based on their overall behavior.
   - Visualize the clusters and interpret the characteristics of each customer group.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Analyze the clusters to understand the traits of each segment.
   - Provide insights into how businesses can use these segments to target customers more effectively.
